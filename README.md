#Eat in Boston

The goal of this exercise is to find Boston's most dangerous Dunkin' Donuts and safest restaurant.

The data sets used were [Active Food Establishment Licenses]
(https://data.cityofboston.gov/Permitting/Active-Food-Establishment-Licenses/gb6y-34cq) and [Crime Incident Reports](https://data.cityofboston.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Incident-Reports/7cdf-6fgx) available from the city of Boston.

Requirements
------------
To code is available as an IPython Notebook and uses Pandas and Geopy as libraries. To install these dependencies use:
```$pip install ipython```
```$pip install pandas```
```$pip install geopy```

Running locally
---------------
Clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mmoyses/EatInBoston) and start IPython notebook in the same directory where the repository was checked out using
```ipython notebook --pylab=inline```

Visualizing online
------------------
There is a way of visualizing the notebook without installing it locally. Just access [NBViewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/mmoyses/EatInBoston/blob/master/Crime%20and%20Restaurants%20in%20Boston.ipynb) and everything can be seen there.
